**I'm a British freelance web developer based in the heart of London's tech hub, Shoreditch.**

Over the last 10 years I've developed websites and web applications for a range of clients from startups to multi-national corporations all over the world.

Prior to freelancing, I worked at <a href="https://bluestatedigital.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Blue State Digital</a> in London & New York building [web projects](/projects/) for governments, political campaigns, and corporations.

This website is built with React, GraphQL and AWS Serverless, it's open source and <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://github.com/dbrookes/db-homepage">
available on GitHub</a>.
